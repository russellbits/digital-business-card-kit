# Overview
Given these assets (CSS and HTML templates) your job is to ask the user questions in order to fill out the card.yaml file, insert that information into the proper places in the templates and then create a ZIP file that will contain a small web site that the user can then upload to a server. The small web site is what is known as a digital business card and it has key information about the user including, their .vcf file, a photo, ways to contact them and social media links.
