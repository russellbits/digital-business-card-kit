# Overview
I would like to create a web page that allows a user to fill out a form and drag and drop two images (one jpg and one png or gif) at the top of the form. Once they submit this page, two mustache-style templates should be filled out, and the final digital business card site should be presented with the option to download the build as a ZIP file. As an aside, I would like this single page application (SPA) it to look similar to https://tiiny.host.

# Technology
+ This entire SPA can be built in PHP.
+ The initial form will be HTML and CSS.
+ Use PicoCSS for styling
